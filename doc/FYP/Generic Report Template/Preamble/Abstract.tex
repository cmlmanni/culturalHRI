This report presents the development and evaluation of an innovative Human-Robot Interaction (HRI) framework that integrates cultural awareness into robot behaviors. The research aims to foster more nuanced and empathetic interactions between humans and robots by incorporating aspects of national culture and identity, such as language, gestures, and social norms. The study combines a mixed-method approach, including software development, experimental design, and theoretical exploration within the multidisciplinary fields of robotics, computer science, and cultural studies.
The research involved creating a series of culturally informed interaction scenarios within the OfficeBots HRI simulation environment. These scenarios were designed to evaluate the framework's capacity to modify robot behaviours based on different cultural contextsâ€”specifically catering to participants from China, Hong Kong, and England, including a participant of Malaysian descent in England. The primary behaviours altered by the framework included language selection, gestural communication, hospitality gestures, and movement dynamics.
The framework was assessed through experiments involving 15 participants who interacted with robots programmed to exhibit culturally congruent behaviours. Quantitative data such as interaction durations and proximity, and qualitative data from participant observations and feedback, were collected and analysed. The results showcased the framework's technical proficiency and highlighted the positive reception of culturally adaptive behaviours by participants, notwithstanding the need for clearer cultural signifiers to optimize user recognition and comprehension.
This report underlines the critical role of cultural adaptability in HRI and discusses the theoretical implications, practical applications, and potential for future research. Limitations are acknowledged with a reflective consideration of the framework's scalability and the prospect of incorporating more dynamic, real-time cultural adaptations. The evaluation concludes with recommendations for extending the HRI framework to enhance cultural sensitivity and personalized user experiences in robotic interactions.
