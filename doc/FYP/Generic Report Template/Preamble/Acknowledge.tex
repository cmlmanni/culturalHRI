This journey through the realms of Human-Robot Interaction (HRI) and Cultural Robotics wouldn't have been possible without the unwavering support from those who accompanied me. I extend my heartfelt thanks to them all.

Firstly, I must express my sincere appreciation for my supervisor, Dr Masoumeh (Iran) Mansouri. Iran's profound wisdom, patient guidance, and deep knowledge in robotics have been invaluable throughout my journey. Her special interest in the intersections of culture, gender theory, and robotics has been a source of constant inspiration. It was under Iranâ€™s mentorship that I, a former Cultural Studies major, was guided into becoming a Computer Scientist within the field of HRI and Cultural Robotics. Every meeting, every discussion, and every critique from Iran has been an invaluable piece of this complex puzzle.

Next, I would like to acknowledge the insightful feedback and sharp insights from my Inspector, Dr Luca Arnaboldi. The feedback on my project played an instrumental role in refining my project, ultimately enhancing the quality of the final output. 

I also wish to express my deep gratitude to the Alistair Harvey Foundation. Their generous provision of a full scholarship enabled my study at the University of Birmingham. The trustees' confidence in my capabilities has been a substantial driving force in my progress.

Opting for the University of Birmingham, I paid homage to the enduring, albeit closed, Centre for Contemporary Cultural Studies (CCCS), whose pioneering theories have profoundly sculpted my path as a former Cultural Studies major. Echoing Raymond Williams \cite{williams1981} at my juncture of culture and technology, I reflect, 'I don't know how many times I've wished I'd never heard the damned word culture.' Despite this, the fusion of these disciplines continues to ignite, shape, and catalyse interdisciplinary scholarly dialogue worldwide.

Lastly, I'd like to extend my deepest gratitude to my partner, Miss Karmen Zheng, who is currently engaged in her own academic challenges in Hong Kong, within the intersection of Cultural Studies and Animal Studies. Despite the geographical distance, her unwavering belief in me and steadfast support have been a rock throughout this journey.

It is with great hope that I anticipate my research making a significant contribution to the field and paving the way for future explorations and discoveries.
